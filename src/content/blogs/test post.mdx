## This is an H2

### Hello, H3

Here are some lines yapping about something that doesn't even matter in the grand scheme of things like how a guy cut me off in traffic today or how a girl smiled at me today.

Here is another line about how I think the universe will end.

## Heading h2

### Sub-Heading h3

#### Sub-Sub Heading h4

Here is an unordered list

- first item
- second item
- third item

Here is a nested list

1. **One**
    - Item One
    - Item Two
2. Two
    1. Item Zero
    2. Item One

`This is some random text in code fences`

## Pygame Example
```python
import pygame
SCREEN = pygame.display.set_mode((512, 512))

run = True
while run:
    SCREEN.fill((0, 0, 0))
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            run = False

    pygame.draw.circle(SCREEN, (255, 255, 255), (256, 256), 20)
    pygame.display.update()
```
## C code 

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *name = "yash";
    printf("Hello to %s's site!", name);

    return 0;
}
```

LaTeX?!!

```math
a, b, c \gt 0 \newline
a^n + b^n = c^n\ \forall\ n > 2
```
## Notes

- LaTeX working but i have to write fuckin code blocks (inline math is not working)
- Obsidian Like Callouts don't work
    - look weird
    - render the text below as blockquote
- internal linking like [[Coutionary Tale]]
    - requires mdx
    - slug is from root so broken
