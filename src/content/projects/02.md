title: Spring Simulation
pubDate: 2023-08-12
description: As a passionate enthusiast of physics and simulations, I undertook a\
    project during my 12th-grade to delve into the intricacies of\
    physics-based simulations. The objective was to develop a realistic cloth\
    simulation using fundamental physics principles, particularly focusing on\
    the behaviour of springs. I was not that focused on the code quality; I\
    will fix this in the future and optimize it. I will make this project in\
    C++ using the SDL or Raylib libraries too.
