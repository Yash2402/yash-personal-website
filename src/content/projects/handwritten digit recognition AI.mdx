## Overview
This project is a basic implementation of a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset using Python and Numpy (without TensorFlow).
The MNIST dataset is a classic benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The task is to classify these images into their respective digit classes. 
In this implementation, a simple feedforward neural network is used to classify the images. The architecture of the neural network is as follows:

- Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels flattened)
- Hidden layer: 10 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output layer: 10 neurons with softmax activation (corresponding to the 10 digit classes)


## Acknowledgments

This implementation is based on tutorials and resources from Youtube Channels like [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), [Samson Zhang](https://www.youtube.com/@SamsonZhangTheSalmon) and other online sources.
Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to improve this implementation!
