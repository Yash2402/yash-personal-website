## Introduction
This website, which is still a work in progress, took me 3-4 weeks to develop. I started working on it when my friend [Aniket Negi](https://aniketnegi.com) 
suggested we create a website together. Since I had some free time, I decided to jump right into it. I'm not sure if this was a 
good idea or not, but so far, I'm really enjoying it!
