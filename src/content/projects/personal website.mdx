## Introduction

This website, which is still a work in progress, took me 3-4 weeks to develop. I started working on it when my friend [Aniket Negi](https://aniketnegi.com)
suggested that we should create our own websites. Since I had some free time, I decided to jump right into it. I'm not sure if this was a
good idea or not, but so far, I'm really enjoying it. I have learned a lot of new things and I'm still learning. I'm using [Astro](https://astro.build) to build this website.

## Why did I create this website?

I created this website to share my thoughts, ideas, and work with the world. This is a place where I can express myself and connect with people. In this world of social media, I wanted a place without any distractions, where I can be myself and share my work with the world.
