title: Ray Casting
pubDate: 2023-09-02
description: This project was also fun. I developed it in 12th grade using Python's\
    Pygame library. It involves casting rays to generate a 3D scene from a 2D\
    map, inspired by a video on ray casting by The Coding Train YouTube\
    channel. This project not only enhanced my understanding of computer\
    graphics and ray casting algorithms but also allowed me to apply\
    mathematical concepts in a creative way. It provided a solid foundation\
    and sparked my interest in exploring ray tracing.
