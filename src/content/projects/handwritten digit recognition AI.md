title: Handwritten Digit Recognition AI
pubDate: 2024-01-24
description: This project represents my initial step into the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It showcases my foundational understanding of neural networks, gradient descent, and essential
    mathematical concepts like linear algebra, differentials, etc. Drawing
    inspiration from educational resources like 3Blue1Brown and Samson Zhang's
    YouTube channels, I embarked on this journey to delve deeper into AI.
